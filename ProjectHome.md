### Abstract ###

This paper presents an equational deductive system for linear temporal logic. It differs from previous developments of such systems in four respects. First, it presents a numbered list of axioms and theorems to indicate which formulas are assumed, which formulas are derived, and for those that are derived, which previous formulas they depend on. Second, it gives a proof of every theorem. Third, the proofs are governed by an equational deductive system as opposed to the older Hilbert-style deductive systems. Fourth, it presents several new and interesting linear temporal theorems.
