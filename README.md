Abstract

This paper presents an equational deductive system for linear temporal logic. It differs from previous developments of temporal logic in several respects. First, the proofs are given in the equational logic developed by Dijkstra and Scholten, and extended by Gries and Schneider, as opposed to the older Hilbert-style logics. Second, it includes all known linear temporal logic theorems plus many new and interesting theorems. Third, although space limitations preclude giving a proof of every theorem in this paper, every theorem has been proved with equational logic.
