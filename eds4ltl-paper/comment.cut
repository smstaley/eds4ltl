The authors would like to thank David Gries, who provided a prepublication manuscript of LADM, which we immediately adopted and have used at our institution ever since.
He has been a source of constant encouragement.
Mordechai Ben-Ari's text \cite{Ben2} inspired us to use LTL to teach concurrent programming principles.
Fred Schneider's graduate-level text \cite{Schn} inspired us to create this equational system to be accessible at the undergraduate level.
Ray McIntyre, Ravi Mohan, Michael Ortiz, and Kyle Sundman contributed to the proofs.
